#  Progressive Web Applications (PWA): Text Editor

## Description

This is a text editor to create notes or code snippets with or without internet connection that runs in the browser. The app is a single-page application that meets the PWA criteria. Additionally, it features a number of data persistence techniques that serve as redundancy in case one of the options is not supported by the browser. The application  also functions offline.

## Usage

You can start the application by "npm run start:dev" then app starts up the backend. When you run text editor application from the terminal your JavaScript files will be bundled using webpack. When you run the webpack plugins, then you  find that you have a generated HTML file, service worker, and a manifest file. When you use next-gen JavaScript in the application, then you  find that the text editor still functions in the browser without errors. When you enter content and subsequently click off of the DOM window, then you find that the content in the text editor has been saved with IndexedDB. When you reopen the text editor after closing it, then you find that the content in the text editor has been retrieved from our IndexedDB.
